# Add Figma integration MCP server

## Summary
- Add Figma integration MCP server
- Supports file access, image export, and component management
- Cross-platform support (macOS/Linux/Windows)
- Available on PyPI as figma-mcp-tools

## Motivation and Context
Designers and developers need seamless access to Figma designs through AI assistants. This MCP server bridges the gap between Figma's design platform and AI tools, enabling users to:
- Browse and search Figma files
- Extract images and assets from designs
- Access design components and tokens
- Manage comments and feedback
- Integrate Figma workflows into AI-assisted development

## How Has This Been Tested?
- ‚úÖ Tested on macOS with Cursor IDE
- ‚úÖ Tested on Linux (Ubuntu) with Claude Desktop
- ‚úÖ Tested on Windows with various MCP clients
- ‚úÖ Verified file access and image export functionality
- ‚úÖ Tested component listing and management
- ‚úÖ Validated comment reading and posting
- ‚úÖ Confirmed cross-platform compatibility
